** DONE AudioEngine integration
** DONE Midi Integration
** DONE Final touches
   Implement tick function.
   Implement strike function. Easy. Done

* DONE Create Minimal GUI with Scanner visualization.
  Damn. Huge pain. Fuck.
  Don't worry about changing any parameters yet.
  Just exiting and saving/loading configuration maybe.
  Need to have a way to switch from stereoscopic to 
  regular visualization.


* TODO Test Simple Wave Scanner
  In-Progress. No working. Scanner apparently has numerous bugs that I will have to
  work through.
