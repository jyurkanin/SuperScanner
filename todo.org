SuperScanner Todo List

* DONE Implement Network ODE

* DONE Integrate with Existing Code
** DONE AudioEngine integration
** DONE Midi Integration
** DONE Final touches
   Implement tick function.
   Implement strike function. Easy. Done

* DONE Create Minimal GUI with Scanner visualization.
  Damn. Huge pain. Fuck.
  Don't worry about changing any parameters yet.
  Just exiting and saving/loading configuration maybe.
  Need to have a way to switch from stereoscopic to 
  regular visualization.

* DONE Test Simple Wave Scanner
  In-Progress. No working. Scanner apparently has numerous bugs that I will have to
  work through.
  Bugs worked through. Sound being produced.

* DONE Damping to simulate Release
  A function that does the opposite of strike()
  It will increase the damping and centering force so that
  the scanner goes to zero. Also need to fix a bug in the audio_engine.

* DONE Add Slew Limiter to tick() function
  Create portamento between notes.
  Made it, but its fucked and idk why.
  I plotted the step response of the slew limiter
  and it is working as intended. Idk why it is making
  a pew sound. It was because I forgot to set k_ = 0.
  Interesting. Idk why an incorrect phase could produce
  that issue.

* DONE Audio Engine bug
  Every like 1/100 strikes gives a weird sound. Might try without -O3.
  Removing O3 got rid of the bug. But also, evaluation was slow as shit.
  Could compile different files with O3 to isolate bug. I think its caused
  by compiling audio_engine with O3. I put the O3 flag on super_scanner.cpp
  only but the problem remains. Idk lol. The problem could be related to
  threading and race conditions. Ignoring for now.
  It was an issue with setting positions to 0 during strike().
  

* DONE Mono Visualization
  Easy
* TODO Gui Features
  Will implement with text boxes.
  Controller will be used for making batch changes.
** DONE Change Scan Path Menu
   What is needed?
   A text box for each index in the scan path. Forget it.
   You were thinking about clicking on shit and typing in values.
   Maybe we can keep typing, but nix clicking. Just use arrow keys
   to scroll.
   Can type the desired number or use arrow keys to scroll up and down.
   Perhaps a top down view of the network with nodes labelled? Done.
   
** DONE Change Node Mass
   Make a menu for this exactly like Scan Path
   Also Map damping to controller
   And release damping.
** DONE Change Connection Matrix
   This is gonna be complex.
   Create new function to handle it. And draw it. Duh.
   not going to draw the scanner. Just connectivity matrix.
** TODO Change EQ Position
   Do a 3 row menu thing.
** DONE Select Hammer Table
   Map to Controller.
** TODO Help Menu
   Print out the possible commands at the home screen.
* DONE Rotate Viewer
  Easy.
* TODO 2D Visualize Scan Path
  This would be easy so I'm not really worried about it.
* TODO Runge-Kutta instead of Euler
  Better accuracy. Less oscillation. Possibly a bit faster.

Hard:
* TODO Adaptive Sampling and Anti-Aliasing


Known bugs:
//Sometimes hangs on exit.
Excessive connectivity leads to instability :(
//Weird segfault and memory corruption.
Viewer has fisheye distortion going on.
